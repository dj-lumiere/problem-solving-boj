### 문제 설명

<p>You are given a positive integer $A$. Find the number of factors of $A$ which are palindromes. A number is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindromic_number" target="_blank">palindrome</a> if it remains the same when the digits in decimal representation are reversed. For instance, 121 is a palindrome, while 123 is not.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, $T$. $T$ lines follow.</p>

<p>Each line represents a test case and contains a single integer $A$.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, output one line containing <code>Case #x: y</code>, where $x$ is the test case number (starting from 1) and $y$ is the number of factors of $A$ which are palindromes.</p>
